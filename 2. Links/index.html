    <h1 id="top">HTML5 Links</h1>

    <p> Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href.
            go to <a href="#h7">heading 7</a> or goto <a href="#h1">heading 1</a> The value of the href attribute is
            the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link. </p>

    <h1 id="h1">Heading 1</h1>

    <p id="p1">At the top of a long page
        you might want to add a list
        of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you might want to add a link from part way
        down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.</p>

    <h1 id="h2">Heading 2</h1>

    <p id="p2">
        Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will
        go to. You do this using the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML element). You can see that the
        and elements in this example have been given id attributes that identify those sections of the page.

    </p>


    <h1 id="h3">HEADING 3</h1>

    <p>
        The value of the id attribute should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character)
        and, on a single page, no two id attributes should have the same value.
        To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the element again, but the value of the href
        attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to
        link to. In this example, links to the element at
        the top of the page whose id attribute has a value of top.
    </p>
